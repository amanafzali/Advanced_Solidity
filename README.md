# Advanced Solity CrowdSale!

## Summary

This crowdsale contract will manage the entire process, allowing users to send ETH and get back PUP (PupperCoin).
This contract will mint the tokens automatically and distribute them to buyers in one transaction.

It will need to inherit `Crowdsale`, `CappedCrowdsale`, `TimedCrowdsale`, `RefundableCrowdsale`, and `MintedCrowdsale`.

You will conduct the crowdsale on the Kovan or Ropsten testnet in order to get a real-world pre-production test in.

## Instructions

Using Remix, create a file called `PupperCoin.sol` and create a standard `ERC20Mintable` token. Since you're already an expert at this,

Create a new contract named `PupperCoinCrowdsale.sol`, and prepare it like a standard crowdsale.

### Designing the contracts

#### ERC20 PupperCoin

You will need to simply use a standard `ERC20Mintable` and `ERC20Detailed` contract, hardcoding `18` as the `decimals` parameter, and leaving the `initial_supply` parameter alone.

You don't need to hardcode the decimals, however since most use-cases match Ethereum's default, you may do so.


#### PupperCoinCrowdsale


You will need to bootstrap the contract by inheriting the following OpenZeppelin contracts:

* `Crowdsale`

* `MintedCrowdsale`

* `CappedCrowdsale`

* `TimedCrowdsale`

* `RefundablePostDeliveryCrowdsale`

You will need to provide parameters for all of the features of your crowdsale, such as the `name`, `symbol`, `wallet` for fundraising, `goal`, etc. Feel free to configure these parameters to your liking.

You can hardcode a `rate` of 1, to maintain parity with Ether units (1 TKN per Ether, or 1 TKNbit per wei). If you'd like to customize your crowdsale rate, follow the [Crowdsale Rate](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/2.x/crowdsales#crowdsale-rate) calculator on OpenZeppelin's documentation. Essentially, a token (TKN) can be divided into TKNbits just like Ether can be divided into wei. When using a `rate` of 1, just like 1000000000000000000 wei is equal to 1 Ether, 1000000000000000000 TKNbits is equal to 1 TKN.

Since `RefundablePostDeliveryCrowdsale` inherits the `RefundableCrowdsale` contract, which requires a `goal` parameter, you must call the `RefundableCrowdsale` constructor from your `PupperCoinCrowdsale` constructor as well as the others. `RefundablePostDeliveryCrowdsale` does not have its own constructor, so just use the `RefundableCrowdsale` constructor that it inherits.

If you forget to call the `RefundableCrowdsale` constructor, the `RefundablePostDeliveryCrowdsale` will fail since it relies on it (it inherits from `RefundableCrowdsale`), and does not have its own constructor.

When passing the `open` and `close` times, use `now` and `now + 24 weeks` to set the times properly from your `PupperCoinCrowdsaleDeployer` contract.

#### PupperCoinCrowdsaleDeployer

In this contract, you will model the deployment based off of the `ArcadeTokenCrowdsaleDeployer` you built previously. Leverage the [OpenZeppelin Crowdsale Documentation](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/2.x/crowdsales).
